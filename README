QES tries to make invoking and communicating with shell scripts easy in Qt/C++.
It is a library that allows for straightforward invocation of shell commands and
joining them into pipes and chains.

\section building Compiling QES
QEasyShell requires QtCore library and a working C++ compiler. That's it! Just
open qeasyshell.pro in QtCreator or run qmake qeasyshell.pro to get started.

No shadow building required, QES automatically puts all the results in build/
and all libraries in lib/.

Building the documentation requires doxygen. Just run doxygen qeasyshell.docconf
in project's root directory.

\section usage Examples
For exmamples on how QES can be used in practice, please see the examples folder.
To put it simply, if you want to run such pipe:
\verbatim
env | grep USER && pwd | wc
\endverbatim

You need to run this in QES:
\verbatim
QesResult *r= QesCommand("env").pipe("grep USER")->chain("pwd")->pipe("wc")->run();
printf(qPrintable(r->toString()), NULL);
\endverbatim

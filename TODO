\brief List of things that should be done in QES

A general list of things that may be implemented in the future, or are being
worked upon right now, in QES. Feel free to suggest, and/ or help implementing
new and existing entries!

\li add option to compile statically
\li support for input and output redirection (1>, 2>>, etc.)
\li proper support for other shells than bash (is it really needed?)
\li add support for passing shell script strings to execute
\li add specialised command classes (like QesGrep etc.) to make it easier to
    invoke some of them
